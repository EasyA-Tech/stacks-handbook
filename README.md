# stacks-handbook
EasyA's legendary handbook. 

# Purpose

This handbook serves as a guide to the Stacks ecosystem, geared towards those just joining for the first time. It isn't just a beginners' handbook; it's a *legendary* handbook. Even if you've already immersed yourself in the ecosystem, you'll find tons of helpful tidbits around here!

# Credit/Inspiration

This handbook was inspired by the famous [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) by sindresorhus. We need awesome lists for Web3 ecosystems, with more of a hacker's guide to how they work. This is the answer to that need.
